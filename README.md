# DIVA Workshops and training

This repository provides a set of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (examples and exercises) for the `DIVAnd` user workshops and training sessions organised in the frame of H2020 [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) project. The notebooks are also used in the [FAIR-EASE](https://fairease.eu/) project.    

[`DIVA`](https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVA) and [`DIVAnd`](https://github.com/gher-uliege/divand.jl) are software tools designed to generate gridded fields from in-situ observations.

## Installation

### Jupyter

Jupyter has to be installed in order to have a notebook interface.    
It can be installed and launched (in Julia) with the following commands

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
using IJulia
notebook()
```

### Extensions [optional]

It is also recommended to install the following modules which allow, for example, to have the sections automatically numbered:
- https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
- https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator

## Other relevant repositories

### [EMODnet-Chemistry-GriddedMaps](https://github.com/gher-uliege/EMODnet-Chemistry-GriddedMaps)

This repository aims to store the notebooks and the instructions to produce the EMODnet Chemistry products (climatologies).

# Binder

Most notebooks need more resources that what is can currently available on Binder. The introduction notebooks (introduction to OI and variationa analysis) however work
